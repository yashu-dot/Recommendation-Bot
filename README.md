# Yelp Recommendation Bot

This project implements a recommendation bot that provides personalized restaurant and business recommendations using the Yelp dataset. The bot uses machine learning techniques to analyze user preferences and predict top recommendations based on ratings, reviews, and other features.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To create a recommendation system that suggests restaurants or businesses tailored to user preferences.
- **Dataset**: The [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) includes detailed information such as:
  - Business information (name, location, category, etc.)
  - User reviews and ratings
  - Check-ins and tips
- **Model**: Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Recommendation algorithms are used to make predictions.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Suggests top-rated businesses based on user history.
- **Hybrid Approach**:
  - Combines collaborative filtering (user-item matrix) with content-based filtering (business attributes and reviews).
- **Interactive Bot**:
  - Users can input preferences, and the bot provides real-time suggestions.
